 //the reason why this is a class, it gets to have both letters be capital
 // the init: is our constructor function
 // for entities it wants 3 parameters
 // the difference between the spriteheight and width vs the regular height and width is that sprite width and sprite height are passing the main info.
 // the regular width and the height is telling the screen what ammount of space to preserve
// this is for the player to move right
//velocity represnts our current position
// me.timer.tick makes the movement look smooth
//adds to the position of my x by the velocity defined above
//delta is the change in time that has happened
//the speed is 80 miliseconds
// what the If (!this statment is saying is, that we dont want to start the walk animation, if we are already walking
//// if we dont add this line the animations wont be able to animate on the fly
// this.flipX fixes the characters turning



//This.broken is the variable we make to say that the tower is not destroyed
//this.health represents how much health you begin with
//this.type is for later collisions
//what the if statement does, is it looks at your health and determines if you are dead
// always call the super in update functions
//we then set the animations on the player and enemy base
// when we break the tower we want to set the animation to broken
//renderable is a class that they built in melon js, we use it to do most animations
//me.game.viewport allows us to follow the player
// This.facing keeps track of hich direction, your character is going
//me.collision is basically just checking for collisions
//what is going on is we are passing our parameter to our function collide.handler
//response.a represents our player
// response.b represents whatever we are colliding with
//vary dif represents the difference between my players y position and the bases y position
// what we want to happen is our Y variable to be dealt with first
// we have not used attack var yet
//this.health-- makes the health go down one
//the attack animation will detect collisions over and over
//this.now keeps track of the time in the game
//this.lastAttack is for a hit delay
//everytime you call for an update you want to change this.now
// our GameManager is not something that will appear on the screen
//It is not an entity it is just something we are using
//we want to make sure the game manager is continuosuly updating
//math.round checks to see if we have a multiple of 10
// this is mod %, it will check and see if we have a multiple of 10
// We want the creeps to drop to the ground and begin walking
// delta represents time as a parameter 
//We want the creeps to drop to the ground and begin walking
// delta represents time as a parameter
// this.attacking lets us know if the nemy is currently attacking
// this.pos.x keeps moving the creep
// we do not want our creep to hit multiple things 
//we put an if else statement so it can only be hitting one of those things
//To the right the x value will be bigger 
//The position change will only happen when the creep is attacking
//  what we want our if else statement in our player function to do is to hurt the creep only when we are attacking
// we are working on the ways we can attack the creeps
// | | this represents and
// If we make the number smaller in Playerattack timer, the player can attack faster and if we make the number bigger the player can attack slower
// now we can just adjust everything in the game.js file
// we are making an if else statement in the game manager to see if the player is dead 
// we are using the reset player function
// renderable fuctions draw instead of update
//renderer is the parameter of the draw function
//we put the coordinates of where we are in the draw function
//we need the event handler to be listening for someone to press the enter button
//without an event handler we cannot check any other way
//we also need to make sure we unbind the key also
// gold will be aquired each game and can be used to buy, power ups
// we have other variables to keep track of how the experience is spent
// we are using local variables to make sure we are keeping track of things such as the experience on the fly
//In video 29 we are basically editing our code and making it shorter
// When the code is trimmed down the way it was, we can manage all of the code more easily  
// we split most of our functions into seperate java script files 
// attributes is for anything different involving leveling up, move speed, health percentage, defense, and more
// flags are things that are either one way or another
// we sorted everything into their own group so everything is more neater
// check if dead is the first function we are building
//attack is a very hard function to classify because there is multiple things that it is related to such as an animation 
// in video 32 what we did was we completed refactoring the rest of our code
//we created a new class for attacking called setAnimation
//right now we are just triming our code so we can keep track of it better
//comments from video 33
//0 and 1 are good parameters
// 2 is a sketchy parameter
//we minimized our main functions that are being used to control the player
// lengthening down our code is better for us when we are trying to check for any errors
// We are setting up our code for SpearThrow

// we set the velocity so that the spear can go fast and not fall

//  we are setting up the spear to collide with the enemy base and the enemy creep

// we have to set another variable so we can set the direction that the spea
